# auto-roller-wheels

A collection of materials, library descriptions, schematics, and all knowledge I need to build automatic indoor roller blinds in my home. This repository serves as a central documentation hub — from ideas and analysis to final build instructions.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to organize all information related to building automatic roller blinds. It helps me avoid chaotic storage of materials and provides a clear structure for documenting progress. The repository allows me to:
- keep tasks organized using Issues,
- document each step of the process,
- store all knowledge in one place for future projects.

## 📂 Repository Contents
The repository will include various file types depending on needs:
- Markdown files (.md),
- images and photos,
- PDF documents,
- Word documents (.docx),
- Excel sheets (.xlsx),
- schematics and diagrams (added later).

This is not a software project — it is a documentation and knowledge repository.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository
There is no traditional run process. To use the repository, you only need the ability to open:
- Markdown files,
- PDFs,
- Word documents,
- Excel files,
- images.

All project logic is stored in documentation.

## 🧩 Features
- structured documentation of the entire roller blind automation project,
- task list and workflow managed through Issues,
- space for schematics, photos, and supporting materials,
- a growing knowledge base for future projects.

## 📁 Repository Structure
There is no fixed structure yet — it will be created as the project evolves.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
The full roadmap is maintained in the **Issues** section. It will include:
- tasks,
- work stages,
- ideas,
- fixes and improvements,
